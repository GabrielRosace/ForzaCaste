The player1 or the player that will play the first move is randomly determined and are also created the Socket.IO rooms used by the server to notify to the clients all events.\n\nThe random matchmaking works that if there are several users waiting to play, the users matching is done based on their ranking: similarly ranked users are matched. However if the players that want to play are only two and their rank is very different, there is a mechanism for matching the two players anyway.\n\n###### Available listener\n\n*   ***gameReady*** event, user receive `{ 'gameReady': true, 'opponentPlayer': \"\"}` to inform both clients that game requests have been accepted and the match will start soon\n*   ***move*** event, player receive `{ 'yourTurn': bool }` that inform the user if it's his turn (`true`) or if it's opponent turn (`false`)\n*   ***gameStatus*** event, received by the observer of the match, that receive `{playerTurn: \"\"}` that informs the observators which player will do the first move\n    \n\n###### Possible responses\n\nThis method respond:\n\n*   HTTP code 404 with this body `{statusCode: 404, errormessage: \"Match creation error\"}` if an error occurs during the creation of the match document\n*   HTTP code 404 with this body `{ statusCode: 404, errormessage: \"Match request update error\" }` if an error occurs during the update of the notification document\n*   HTTP code 404 with this body `{ statusCode: 404, errormessage: \"Match request already exists\" }` if already exists a request for a match against a random user from the same user\n*   HTTP code 404 with this body `{ statusCode: 404, errormessage: \"Random game request creation error\" }` if an error occurs during the creation of the notification document\n*   HTTP code 400 with this body `{ statusCode: 400, errormessage: \"Invalid request\" }` if the value of he field `\"type\"` is incorrect\n*   HTTP code 400 with this body `{statusCode: 400, errormessage: \"Bad Request\"}` if `type` is not included in the request body\n*   HTTP code 404 with this body `{statusCode: 404, errormessage: \"DB error\"}` if an operation on the DB raises an error\n*   HTTP code 401 with this body `{ statusCode: 401, errormessage: \"Unauthorized\" }` if the user that made the request is not authorized for that operation\n*   HTTP code 200 with this body `{ error: false, message: \"Match request has been created correctely\" }` if the match has been created correctely. It means that the game document has been created and the notification document for the game request has been updated.\n*   HTTP code 200 with this body `{ error: false, errormessage: \"Match has been created correctely\" }` if the match have been created so the players will play the match soon\n    \n\n### Below is an example of the body for this request, the specified field and the value are mandatory"
